# [1.1.0] - 2019-06-20
Yay! New version of Cohesity Management SDK is here!

### Added 
- This SDK now supports Cohesity DataPlatform 6.3

### Changed
- (BREAKING CHANGE) Models names have changed because the way we genereated the models was not consistent. We did to ensure future versions of the SDK are 100% backward compatible. 

### Fixed
- None
 
### Removed
- Tenants controller(tenants_controller.py) is removed, now all the endpoints related to tenants are in tenant_controller.py
